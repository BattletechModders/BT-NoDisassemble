# No Disassemble

A mod for HBS's BattleTech:Game that allows you to not assemble mechs when you get above the mech part threshold.

### TODOs

- [x] figure out how to block assembly
- [ ] allow opt-out of assembly from popup
- [x] fix display issue for too many parts in mech bay
- [ ] work with morph to allow mech selection upon assembly of different chassis
